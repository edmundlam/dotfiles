# dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles for macOS. Dotfiles are configuration files that are used to 
customize and personalize your system. This repo is intended to help me quickly set up a new system to my 
liking and to keep track of the changes I make to my configurations.


## Run the configuration manifest

```bash
./install
```
